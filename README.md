# py_sweeper
### A cool minesweeper game, developed in Python, based on a Tutorial series developed by [@jumdevops19](https://github.com/jimdevops19).

### You can find the original game [here](https://github.com/jimdevops19/MinesweeperGame), or by following the Youtube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqbGRZx4xUc&t=1s).

##### Big ups for [freeCodeCamp.org](freecodecamp.org) and [@jumdevops19](https://github.com/jimdevops19).

## Minesweeper 
Here is a quick tutorial on [how to play Minesweeeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvvrOeITzG8).

## Differentiators from the original design of the tutorial:
Besides the design, this version of the game dynamically assignes the cell, based on the screen size and difficulty.
